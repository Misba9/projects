Step 0: Add HTML

Hello there, welcome to the first step of building a Todo list app on your own. In this step, your task is to only build the front end project. We will build the underlying functionality in later steps.

In order to create a simple to-do list, we have to follow the following four steps:

Line 11: We make a div that acts as a container for our to-do list.

Lines 12 – 16: We make a div for the new task in which the user writes the name of the task, and at the end, it has the “add” button.

Line 17: We create a div for the written tasks.
